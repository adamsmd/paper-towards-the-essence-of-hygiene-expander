Running the tests
=================

To test this code, just load `tests.scm`.

The output should be:

    Running 'or-test0'
    Running 'or-test1'
    Running 'or-test2'
    Running 'or-test4'
    Running 'inc-test1'

If one of the tests fails, then `!!! FAILED !!!` will be printed under
the appropriate test.

This code has been tested under Chez Scheme 8.3 and Vicare Scheme 0.3d7.


Running the expander
====================

To directly run the expander, import the `(expand)` library and call
`(expand-s-expr #f env0 <s-expr>)` where the value of `<s-expr>` is
an s-expression containing the expression to expand.

You can replace `#f` with a number for the maximum number of expansion
steps to take.

If you have a different set of core forms, you can replace `env0` with
a new default environment.  (TODO: zero is valid)

TODO: put binder atoms in different domain of gensyms
TODO: explain that ref atoms are not gensymed until needed

For example, if you call the following

    (expand-s-expr #f env0
      '(let-syntax ([and2 (lambda (stx)
                            (list #'if (cadr stx) (caddr stx) #'#f))])
        (and2 x y)))

then you should get something like the following

    (let-syntax ((and2@1 (lambda (stx@2)
                           (list '#(if if) (cadr stx@2) (caddr stx@2) '#f))))
  (if x y '#f))

## Note ##

The expander internally operates over k-syntax objects.  The
`expand-s-expr` function automatically injects into and projects out
of these k-syntax objects.  The s-expr notation is easier to read but
loses some information.  Specifically, identifiers are translated into
an easier-to-read vector notation.

The `expand-k-syntax` function operates the same as `expand-s-expr`
except that it uses these k-syntax objects.  See the implementation of
`expand-s-expr` for how to inject into and project out of k-syntax.

Limitations
===========

Main aim of this code is an implementation of the algorithm described
in "Towards the Essence of Hygiene".  For the sake of clarity we make
several simplifications.

 - As in "Towards the Essence of Hygiene", we do not implement
   `datum->syntax`, `syntax->datum`, `define`, or `define-syntax`.

 - As in "Towards the Essence of Hygiene", the algorithm we implement
   is quadratic in the size of the input though a full syntax-case
   implementation can be linear.

 - We directly implement the algorithm in the first half of "Towards
   the Essence of Hygiene" (i.e., the one using a gensym) instead of
   the nominal based implementation described in the latter half of
   "Towards the Essence of Hygiene".

 - `syntax-case` is both a hygienic algorithm and a pattern matching
   form used with that algorithm.  This code just implements the
   hygienic expansion algorithm and does not implement pattern
   matching or the forms that go with it.  This includes the
   `syntax-case`, `quasisyntax`, and `unquote` syntax forms.
   (Though, these can actually be implemented as macros within the
   system implemented by this code.)

 - We do not implement advanced macro features like modules, R6RS
   libraries, or define-meta.

 - Since we use `gensym` to create fresh identifiers and that is not a
   standardized feature, we implement our own version of `gensym`.  We
   reserve the character `@` for this purpose and assume no
   non-gensymed symbols ever involve that character.
